crunchy-xml-decoder
===================

Requires PyCrypto (http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/modules.shtml#pycrypto)

If you get errors about or relating to lxml, delete the "lxml" folder from the crunchy-xml-decoder folder and rename lxml_32 or lxml_64 to lxml depending on the version of Python you have installed, not Windows.
